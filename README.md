# redis-backup-restore
This little tool helps to backup a redis server and restore it
Just download and build in the visual studio.

It uses servicestack.redis and you can get it thru nuget.

Future plan,

1) make a progress bar and be able to pause/resume
2) use one big data file instead of millions of smaller ones.
